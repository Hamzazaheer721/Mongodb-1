  - $exists => Syntax => { field: { $exists: <boolean> } } 
  - When <boolean> is true, then it will match all the documents where the fields exists, regardless of what value is assigned to them.
    - Fields can be even null
    - This property is like the Object.hasOwnProperty()
  - If the <boolean> is false, then it will match all the documents where the field is absent.
  
  
  - For Example: 
    - db.inventory.find( { qty: { $exists: true, $nin: [ 5, 15 ] } } );
    - It will match all the documents where the quantity field is present and its value is not 5 or 15.
