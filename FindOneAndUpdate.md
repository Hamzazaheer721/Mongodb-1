- FindOneAndUpdate Options
   - new: true is used to return the updated Document after it has been updated against right filter and update.
   - useFineAndModify: false is used to avoid the depreciation error.
   - upsert: true will check if the document is found against filter if its not found then mongodb will add the document by combining filter and update.
   - rawResult: true will check if the document is upserted or not. the resultant document result will come like => { lastErrorObject: {}, value: {}, ok: 1}
      - document.value instanceof Users // true or false
      - document.lastErrorObject.updatedExisting // true if mongodb didn't upserted and viceversa
